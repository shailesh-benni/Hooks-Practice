# React Hooks Playground 🧠⚛️

This repository contains hands-on examples and explanations of **React Hooks**. It's perfect for anyone looking to get started with hooks or strengthen their understanding by experimenting with real code.

## 🔥 What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in **React 16.8** and have since become the standard way to manage state, side effects, and more in React apps.

## 📚 Hooks Covered

| Hook Name        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `useState`       | Add state to functional components |
| `useEffect`      | Perform side effects like fetching data |
| `useContext`     | Access context without wrapping in `<Consumer>` |
| `useRef`         | Access and persist values without causing re-renders |
| `useReducer`     | Manage complex state logic (like Redux) |
| `useMemo`        | Optimize performance by memoizing values |
| `useCallback`    | Memoize functions to avoid unnecessary re-renders |
| `useLayoutEffect` | Like `useEffect`, but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations |
| `useImperativeHandle` | Customize instance value exposed to parent via `ref` |
| `custom hooks`   | Create your own reusable logic hooks |
